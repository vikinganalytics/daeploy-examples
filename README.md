# daeploy-examples

Ready-to-use examples of Daeploy services that show off useful functionality. Daeploy services are deployed to a manager application that can be started using the start_manager script.

To start a manager on localhost on a linux machine:

```bash
$ chmod +x ./start_manager
$ ./start_manager
```
